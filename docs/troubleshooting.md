# Troubleshooting

> 中文版：[`troubleshooting.zh-CN.md`](troubleshooting.zh-CN.md)

A focused FAQ for the most common deployment / runtime issues. If your
question is not here, [`SUPPORT.md`](../.github/SUPPORT.md) routes you to the
right channel.

> Tip: most issues become diagnosable in seconds once you have logs.
> Set `web_ui.log_level = "DEBUG"` in `config.toml` (or
> `AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for the standalone server,
> or `ai-intervention-agent.logLevel` to `debug` in VS Code). Then
> reproduce and grab the **last 20-30 lines** of stderr / Output.

## 1. Web UI does not start (port already in use)

**Symptom**: MCP tool calls hang; VS Code Output shows
`Address already in use` or `Errno 48`; browser cannot reach
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

**Cause**: another process owns port `8080` (the default for
`web_ui.port`). Common culprits: a previous orphaned `ai-intervention-agent`
process, another local dev server, or a system service that grabbed
the port at boot.

**Fix** (sorted from fastest to slowest):

```bash
# Option A — Temporary override (no file edits, IDE restart only)
#
# Lands the new port immediately the next time the MCP server starts.
# Survives the current shell session but resets on logout.
export AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_WEB_UI_PORT=8181
# Restart your AI client (Cursor / VS Code) so the MCP process
# re-resolves the env var. See docs/configuration.md#environment-variable-overrides.

# Option B — Permanent change (edit config.toml)
#
# Locate the file with:
#   ai-intervention-agent --help  # version + bin path
#   uvx ai-intervention-agent     # then check banner: "config_file_path=..."
#
# Then edit:
#   [web_ui]
#   port = 8181

# Option C — Free the port instead of changing it
pkill -f ai-intervention-agent || true
lsof -nP -iTCP:8080 -sTCP:LISTEN  # confirm it's clear
```

If you change the port (Option A or B), also update
`ai-intervention-agent.serverUrl` in VS Code settings
(e.g. `http://localhost:8181`).

## 2. VS Code panel is blank / shows "Loading..." forever

**Symptom**: the AI Intervention Agent activity bar icon opens an
empty / spinning panel.

**Common causes & fixes**:

- **Web UI is not reachable from VS Code** — confirm
  `ai-intervention-agent.serverUrl` matches the actual Web UI URL.
  Open it in a browser; if the browser fails too, see issue #1.
- **MCP server has not started yet** — call any MCP tool once
  (e.g. `interactive_feedback`) so the server can spawn the Web UI
  subprocess. The panel polls; once the URL is up, it renders within
  ~2 seconds.
- **Webview crashed silently** — Output → "AI Intervention Agent" should
  show a 5-line boot log (`webview.resolve`, `webview.boot`,
  `webview.ready`, `webview.config_loaded`,
  `webview.first_task_rendered`). If it stops mid-way, the line that
  fired last tells you the failing stage.
- **Network firewall** — corporate Zscaler / Endpoint Security
  occasionally blocks `localhost` requests from VS Code. Ask IT for
  an exception, or run with `web_ui.host = "0.0.0.0"` and use the
  LAN IP.

## 3. Task list is empty after the AI calls `interactive_feedback`

**Symptom**: the AI says "I'm waiting for your input" but the Web UI
does not show the task.

**Diagnostic order**:

1. **Refresh the page once** — if the task appears, your browser
   missed an SSE event during a network blip. Update to the latest
   release; v1.5.x ships [`Last-Event-ID`-based SSE replay][sse].
2. **Check that the MCP server and the Web UI agree on the task
   queue** — run `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/tasks` and confirm
   the task is present server-side. If yes, the bug is in the
   browser; clear cache + hard reload.
3. **Look for `Web service already running on a different port`**
   in the MCP server log — the parent process found an old web UI
   on the configured port and skipped spawning a fresh one. Kill
   the orphan (issue #1) and retry.

## 4. No notifications arrive (Web / sound / system / Bark)

| Channel | Most common cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Web** | Browser tab is in the background and OS denied permission | Click the bell icon on the page → "Allow notifications". On Safari, also enable in System Settings → Notifications → Safari. |
| **Sound** | `notifications.sound_mute = true` or volume = 0 | Settings page → Sound → toggle "Mute" off, raise volume. iOS / iPadOS require the page to be foregrounded once per session. |
| **System (plyer)** | macOS missing `pyobjus` (intentional skip) | macOS native notifications via plyer are intentionally skipped; the project relies on `macos_native_enabled = true` (`osascript`-based) instead. Linux requires `libnotify`; Windows uses Toast. |
| **Bark** | Wrong device key, push server unreachable, or `bark_url` not pointing at your self-hosted instance | Test the URL with `curl -v "$BARK_URL/$DEVICE_KEY/test"`. Set `bark_action = "url"` + `bark_url_template = "{base_url}/?task_id={task_id}"` for a click-through deep link. **If the URL would resolve to a loopback address** (`localhost` / `127.x.x.x` / `::1`) the agent now suppresses it server-side — the phone never gets a useless click target — and the Web UI Bark settings panel surfaces a copy-pasteable LAN-IP suggestion (`http://<lan-ip>:<port>`). Apply that to `web_ui.external_base_url` (or expose mDNS) and re-trigger. |

## 5. mDNS (`ai.local`) does not resolve on the LAN

**Symptom**: phone / tablet on the same Wi-Fi cannot open
`http://ai.local:8080`, but `http://<laptop-IP>:8080` works.

**Causes**:

- **mDNS only publishes when bound to a non-loopback interface**.
  Set `network_security.bind_interface` to your LAN IP (e.g. `192.168.x.y`)
  or `0.0.0.0`, not `127.0.0.1`. (`bind_interface` lives under the
  `[network_security]` section, not `[web_ui]` — it overrides
  `web_ui.host` at runtime.)
- **macOS Sleep / Wi-Fi power-save** drops the Bonjour record after
  ~5 minutes of idle. Either pin caffeinate, or just refresh the
  page on the phone — re-resolution is usually instant.
- **Corporate / hotel Wi-Fi blocks multicast**. Switch to a personal
  hotspot or pre-share the IP-based URL via QR code (the settings
  page will print one once `web_ui.host = "0.0.0.0"`).

## 6. `Open in IDE` button does nothing / opens the wrong editor

**Symptom**: clicking "Open in IDE" on the settings page is silently
ignored.

**Why**: the endpoint enforces three guards (see `.github/SECURITY.md`):

1. **Loopback only** — non-loopback origins are 403'd.
2. **Path whitelist** — the only paths it will hand to a child
   process are the resolved active config file and `config.toml.default`.
3. **Editor priority**: `AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_OPEN_WITH` env var →
   request body's `editor` field → auto-detect chain
   (cursor / code / windsurf / subl / webstorm / pycharm) → system
   default opener (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start`).

**Fix**:

```bash
# 1. Confirm an editor is on PATH:
which cursor code  # one of these should resolve

# 2. Force a specific editor:
export AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_OPEN_WITH=cursor

# 3. Restart the MCP server so the env var is inherited.
```

## 7. PWA "Install" / "Add to Home Screen" prompt does not appear

**Symptom**: visiting the Web UI in Chrome / Edge / Safari does not
offer to install it as a Progressive Web App.

**Checklist**:

- The PWA install prompt requires **HTTPS or `localhost`**. LAN access
  via plain HTTP `http://192.168.x.y:8080` will never trigger it on
  modern browsers; iOS Safari is the most permissive but still wants
  the user to actively use "Add to Home Screen".
- Confirm the manifest is reachable: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/manifest.webmanifest`
  should return JSON with `start_url`, `icons`, and `display: standalone`.
- iOS users: `Share` → `Add to Home Screen` always works regardless
  of the install banner heuristics.

## 8. Tapping a Bark notification on my phone opens the Bark app instead of the PWA

**Symptom**: you receive the Bark push, but tapping it lands on Bark's
home screen / "no URL configured" message instead of opening the
AI Intervention Agent feedback page.

**Cause** (almost always one of these two):

1. **The push payload had no `url` field** — the agent detected the
   resolved URL was a loopback address and stripped it (introduced in
   the `bark-r42` round). Loopback URLs cannot route from a phone back
   to your laptop's `localhost`; sending them would always fail.
2. **`bark_action` is set to a value other than `"url"`** — `bark_action
   = "default"` lets the user tap to dismiss; only `"url"` (or any
   absolute http/https URL) makes the Bark app deep-link.

**Fix**:

1. Open the Web UI (or VS Code extension) → **Settings → Notifications →
   Bark**. The new diagnostic panel under the URL template shows one of:
   - `OK: Click target = http://<your-lan-ip>:<port>` — everything is
     fine, retry from the AI client.
   - `Loopback detected — phones cannot reach <url>` + a one-click "Copy
     LAN URL" button. Click it, paste into `web_ui.external_base_url`,
     save, and retry.
   - `Cannot detect any LAN IP` — your machine is offline or only on a
     VPN that hides interfaces. Switch to LAN-bound Wi-Fi or use the
     mDNS `<host>.local` URL.
2. (Optional) Verify with `curl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/system/network-base-url-status`
   — the `recommendation` field tells you exactly which knob to turn:
   `ok` / `configure_external_base_url` / `bind_lan_interface`.

> Note: `0.0.0.0` is **not** a valid `external_base_url` — it's a wildcard
> bind on the server side, not a reachable address from the phone. The
> diagnostic panel rejects it with the same loopback warning.

## 9. CI Gate fails locally but passes in GitHub Actions (or vice versa)

**Symptom**: `uv run python scripts/ci_gate.py` reports a failure
that does not reproduce in CI; or the opposite.

**Most common causes**:

- **uv lock drift** — your local `uv.lock` is older. `uv sync --all-groups`
  brings them aligned. CI uses `--frozen`; mismatch surfaces as
  `Locked dependency not found` or transitive version skew.
- **fnm vs system Node** — the i18n red-team smoke check runs Node.
  CI pins `v24`; locally `node --version` may differ. Use
  `fnm exec --using v24.14.0 -- npm run vscode:check` if `npm run`
  picks up the wrong Node.
- **timezone-sensitive tests** — `tests/test_i18n_relative_time_thresholds.py`
  computes "x minutes ago" in the local timezone. Run with
  `TZ=UTC uv run pytest tests/test_i18n_relative_time_thresholds.py`
  to bisect.

If none of the above explains it, capture the full output and open a
[bug report][bug] with the `[ci]` prefix.

[bug]: https://github.com/xiadengma/ai-intervention-agent/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml

## 10. `Dependency Review` GitHub check fails on every PR with "not supported on this repository"

**Symptom**: Every PR (including untouched dependabot PRs) reports
the `Dependency Review` workflow as failing, with the log line:

```
##[error]Dependency review is not supported on this repository.
Please ensure that Dependency graph is enabled, see
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/security_analysis
```

The other CI checks (`Tests`, `VSCode`, `CodeQL`, `actionlint`) may
pass — only `Dependency Review` is red.

**Root cause**: GitHub's `actions/dependency-review-action` requires
the repository's **Dependency graph** feature to be enabled.
Dependency graph is enabled by default for **public** repos but
**disabled by default for private** repos and for forks. If you
recently switched the repo from private → public, or if you are
running the workflow on a fork, the feature may still be off.

**Fix** (one-time, repo owner only):

1. Go to `Settings` → `Code security` (or `Security & analysis`
   depending on the GitHub UI version).
2. Under **Dependency graph**, click **Enable**. This also unblocks
   `Dependabot alerts` and `Dependabot security updates` if you
   want those.
3. Re-run the failing `Dependency Review` job from the PR's
   "Checks" tab — it should now turn green within a minute.

**How to verify with the API** (without the UI):

```bash
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/vulnerability-alerts -i
# 204 No Content → vulnerability alerts (and dependency graph) ON
# 404 Not Found  → OFF — `Dependency Review` will keep failing
```

Until this is enabled, the `Dependency Review` red check is purely
infrastructural and **does not indicate** an actual vulnerability or
license violation in the PR's dependencies.

## 11. Cursor shows "Extension host terminated unexpectedly 3 times within the last 5 minutes"

**Symptom**: Cursor surfaces a banner reading
`Extension host terminated unexpectedly 3 times within the last 5
minutes.` Sometimes the language drops to English even though you had
configured Chinese; sometimes the banner only appears while
`interactive_feedback` is mid-flight (waiting on a human reply).

**Important upstream context**: this is a **Cursor IDE-side known
issue**, not specifically caused by ai-intervention-agent. The
[Cursor community forum thread][cursor-ext-host] reports the same
banner appearing on Cursor 2.4.14 and earlier **even when every
extension is disabled**. The "language reset" symptom is also a Cursor
extension-host restart side effect (the language picker re-reads
defaults after the host respawns).

[cursor-ext-host]: https://forum.cursor.com/t/how-to-recover-from-extension-host-terminated-unexpectedly-3-times/148772

**Defensive measures already in this project (so the banner is unlikely
to come from ai-intervention-agent itself)**:

- The MCP `interactive_feedback` tool **ignores** any caller-supplied
  `timeout` / `timeout_seconds` argument, so it can never get stuck
  with a too-small timeout (`timeout=1` is the well-known mcp-feedback-
  enhanced regression and we are immune to it by design).
- `wait_for_task_completion` clamps backend timeout via
  `max(timeout, server_config.BACKEND_MIN=260)` and `calculate_backend_timeout`.
- `server.py::main()` runs the MCP loop under a 3-retry harness with
  `cleanup_services()` between attempts and `KeyboardInterrupt`-based
  graceful shutdown.
- R114 (notification manager) silences the benign atexit / shutdown
  TOCTOU race, so the noisy `ERROR: 处理通知事件失败` log lines no
  longer appear during host restart and can no longer be confused
  with a genuine MCP-side fault.

**Triage order**:

1. **Confirm it really is the MCP server.** In Cursor, open the MCP
   server panel (the one listing `ai-intervention-agent` and any
   other MCP servers); the connection light should be **green**. If
   it stays green throughout the banner, the crash is in some other
   Cursor extension and the workaround below applies regardless.
2. **Try Cursor's own recovery first.** `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` →
   `Developer: Restart Extension Host`. If the banner stops repeating,
   the underlying state was transient.
3. **Update Cursor.** The forum thread tracks a stream of fixes in
   newer Cursor releases (post-2.4.14). Updating is the single highest-
   leverage action.
4. **Inspect the MCP server log** to rule out our side. With
   `web_ui.log_level = "DEBUG"`, look in stderr for either:
   - `处理通知事件失败` ERROR lines → if you see these on a current
     release (post-R114), please [open an issue][bug] with the line.
   - `[R114] _executor.submit 与 shutdown 竞态` DEBUG lines → these
     are **expected** during shutdown / restart and can be ignored;
     they are the post-R114 silenced form of the old ERROR.
5. **If the banner only fires while** `interactive_feedback` **is
   blocking on you**, you are seeing the long-poll (default
   `frontend_countdown=240s` + `BACKEND_BUFFER=40s` ≈ 280s wait)
   colliding with Cursor's extension-host watchdog. As of Cursor
   2.4.14 there is no documented public knob to extend that watchdog
   from the MCP server side, so the practical workaround is to keep
   the Web UI / VS Code panel foregrounded and reply within the
   countdown.

If after the above the banner still reproduces and the MCP log is
clean, please file the issue against
[Cursor's tracker][cursor-bugs] (with your `ai-intervention-agent`
version and the relevant `Help → Toggle Developer Tools → Console`
trace) and cross-link it from a [GitHub Discussion][disc] here so we
can mirror upstream progress.

## 12. Open VSX publish step fails (`displayName` mismatch / pinned `ovsx` upgrade)

**Symptom**

Release workflow's `open-vsx` job exits with one of:

```
ERROR: Display name in extension.vsixmanifest and package.json does not match.
ERROR: Description in extension.vsixmanifest and package.json does not match.
ERROR: Categories in extension.vsixmanifest and package.json do not match.
```

— typically *only* the Open VSX job, with the same VSIX uploading
fine to the Microsoft VS Code Marketplace.

### Why this happens

`ovsx publish`'s server-side validator strict-checks that string
fields in `package.json` (after NLS placeholder resolution) literally
match the corresponding fields in the VSIX's `extension.vsixmanifest`.
NLS placeholders in `package.json` (e.g. `"%displayName%"`) are
**not** resolved by `ovsx`; they're forwarded as-is and compared
against the resolved manifest. The Microsoft Marketplace tolerates
this; Open VSX (since ~2026-05) does not.

This historically broke v1.6.1 — see
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md#162--2026-05-10) — when the floating
`npx --yes ovsx publish` tag picked up a newly-strict version of
ovsx between v1.6.0 (2026-05-08, succeeded) and v1.6.1 (2026-05-10,
failed) without any code change on our side.

### Fix tier 1 — match content literally

Hard-code the affected field in `packages/vscode/package.json` to the
literal string instead of `"%placeholderKey%"`:

```diff
- "displayName": "%displayName%",
+ "displayName": "AI Intervention Agent",
```

The field is ASCII / Latin so the localised look-up was buying us
nothing; the other fields that *do* differ across locales
(`activitybar.title`, `views.title`, `commands.title`) keep their
NLS placeholders because those are user-visible strings that benefit
from translation.

The drift guard
[`tests/test_vscode_displayname_literal_for_ovsx.py`](../tests/test_vscode_displayname_literal_for_ovsx.py)
locks `displayName` as a literal and demands the NLS bundles
agree, so a future regression fails CI rather than the next release.

### Fix tier 2 — pin the toolchain (R149)

Even with literal content, a future `ovsx` tightening could rebreak
us silently if we kept the floating tag. R149 pins both invocations
in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
- name: 发布到 Open VSX（从 VSIX 发布）
  run: |
    npx --yes ovsx@0.10.9 verify-pat xiadengma -p "$OVSX_TOKEN"
    npx --yes ovsx@0.10.9 publish -p "$OVSX_TOKEN" vsix/*.vsix
```

[`tests/test_release_workflow_ovsx_pinned_r149.py`](../tests/test_release_workflow_ovsx_pinned_r149.py)
rejects floating invocations and demands matching pins on both
lines.

### Upgrading the pinned `ovsx` version (manual ritual)

Toolchain upgrades are deliberately tracked PRs, not silent drift:

1. **Verify the new version against a dry VSIX first.**
   In a scratch directory:

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/xiadengma/ai-intervention-agent
   cd ai-intervention-agent/packages/vscode
   npm ci
   npm run build:vscode      # produces dist/vsix/*.vsix
   npx --yes ovsx@<new>.<x>.<y> verify-pat xiadengma -p "$YOUR_OVSX_PAT"
   ```

   If `verify-pat` succeeds, `ovsx@<new>.<x>.<y>` accepts the same
   PAT format. Move on.

2. **Bump `release.yml` in lockstep.** Edit both lines so the
   `ovsx@<X.Y.Z>` substring is identical. The matching-pins test
   (`test_publish_and_verify_use_same_pin`) catches a one-line
   bump.

3. **Re-run release on a sacrificial tag** (e.g. tag a
   `vX.Y.Z-rc1`, push it, watch the workflow). If the new ovsx
   accepts the existing VSIX, ship for real on the next PATCH /
   MINOR release. If it rejects, revert the pin to the previous
   working version and file an upstream issue against
   [`eclipse-openvsx/cli`](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/issues).

4. **Update the inline comment in `release.yml`** so future
   maintainers can see when each pin was last verified, e.g.

   ```yaml
   # R149 — pin ovsx version. Pinned to <new>.<x>.<y> on YYYY-MM-DD
   # after verifying <upstream changelog link>.
   ```

5. **Update this section** to mention the new version.

> **Note** — `npx --yes ovsx@latest` is **never** correct in a CI
> workflow even as a "temporary" measure. It re-creates the same
> drift that broke v1.6.1. If a release is blocked because the
> currently-pinned ovsx has a known bug, revert to the *previous*
> known-working pin (find it in `git log` for `release.yml`) rather
> than going floating.

## 13. Client/server payload field-name drift (R154 lesson)

**Symptom** — A status indicator, dashboard row, or test self-check
silently shows "stale" / "—" / "unknown" even though the underlying
HTTP endpoint is healthy and returns data. Most often:

- The Activity Dashboard's `Recent logs` row stays "—" while
  `curl /api/system/recent-logs` returns entries.
- A self-test verdict line stays "no verdict" while the dispatch
  itself succeeded.
- The settings UI shows "no provider stats" while
  `curl /api/system/health` returns per-provider rows.

**Root cause** — The server endpoint renamed a top-level JSON field
(e.g. `entries → logs`, `stats → counters`) **or** the client JS
reads under a different name than the server emits. The fetch
succeeds, the JSON parses, but the consumer reads `undefined` and
treats the row as "no data".

R152's `_formatLogs` shipped with `var entries = logs.logs` while
the server has always shipped `entries`. The dashboard's `Recent
logs` row was permanently stale in production until R153 caught
and fixed it.

**What to do if you suspect drift**

1. **Run** `uv run pytest tests/test_system_endpoint_payload_contract_r154.py -v`.
   It locks the four `/api/system/...` + `/api/tasks` field surfaces
   against the JS consumer; any miss surfaces as a clear failure.
2. If the test passes but the symptom persists, **inspect the live
   payload** with `curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/<endpoint> | jq`
   and compare keys to the JS read-side in
   `src/ai_intervention_agent/static/js/activity_dashboard.js`.
3. **Add a new pin** to `tests/test_system_endpoint_payload_contract_r154.py`
   for the newly-discovered field so the next regression is caught
   structurally.

**Prevention going forward** — Treat every endpoint's top-level
field name as part of the public client contract. Renames must
land on both sides in the same PR + the test must update in
lockstep. Don't ship a "client first" rename hoping the server
catches up — the dashboard will silently degrade in the interim.

## Still stuck?

1. Read [`SUPPORT.md`](../.github/SUPPORT.md) for the right channel.
2. For security-related symptoms, **do not** open a public issue —
   follow [`SECURITY.md`](../.github/SECURITY.md).
3. Open a [GitHub Discussion][disc] if you are not sure whether it's
   a bug, configuration, or environment problem.
