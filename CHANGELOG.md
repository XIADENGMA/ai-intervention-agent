## [1.5.21] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **MCP server identity** advertised in the `initialize` response: `name`,
  `version` (auto-resolved from `importlib.metadata`), `instructions` (Chinese
  guide on when to / not to call the tool), `website_url`, and self-contained
  `icons` (4 base64 data URIs covering 32/192/512 PNG + SVG, ~17 KB total, no
  remote CDN dependency).
- **MCP tool annotations** on `interactive_feedback`: `title`,
  `readOnlyHint=False`, `destructiveHint=False`, `idempotentHint=False`,
  `openWorldHint=True`. Clients (ChatGPT Desktop / Claude Desktop / Cursor)
  no longer ask for "destructive operation" confirmation on every call.
- 20 contract tests in `tests/test_tool_annotations.py` and
  `tests/test_server_identity.py` to lock the new metadata and prevent silent
  regressions.

### Documentation

- New "Server-level metadata" and "Tool-level annotations" sections in
  `docs/mcp_tools.md` and `docs/mcp_tools.zh-CN.md`.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Pydantic-validated fallbacks and alias mapping for `interactive_feedback`,
  so drift parameters (`summary` / `prompt` / `project_directory` /
  `submit_button_text` / `timeout` / `feedback_type` / `priority` /
  `language` / `tags` / `user_id`) no longer break first-call validation.
- Full PWA icon family (`manifest.webmanifest` + 16/32/180/192/512 PNG + SVG)
  with `maskable` purpose for adaptive icons; Web UI now passes Lighthouse
  PWA installability checks.
- Default-selection support for `predefined_options` in three input shapes
  (`str` / `dict` / `list`), with the multi-task UI honouring the default
  while still allowing the user to change it.
- "Open in IDE" button on the settings page, gated by:
  - **Loopback-only** (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) — remote requests are rejected.
  - **Path whitelist** — only the resolved active config file and
    `config.toml.default` are openable; never accepts an arbitrary path.
  - **No shell** — commands are passed as argument lists to `subprocess.Popen`
    with `shell=False`, blocking shell injection.
  - Editor priority: env var `AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_OPEN_WITH` → request
    `editor` → auto-detect (cursor / code / windsurf / subl / webstorm /
    pycharm) → system default (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start`).
- Bark notification deep-linking via `bark_url_template` with placeholders
  `{task_id}`, `{event_id}`, `{base_url}` so iOS users can jump straight to
  the relevant feedback task.

### Changed

- `PROMPT_MAX_LENGTH` raised from 500 to 10 000 characters to match the
  longer prompts agents now produce.
- `interactive_feedback` docstring overhauled with use cases, parameter
  guidance, and behavior contract — visible to LLM agents at registration.
- VS Code extension `engines.vscode` aligned with `@types/vscode` to keep
  the extension host and the type checker on the same baseline.
- `web_ui_routes/system.py` test coverage raised from 13.02% to 79.53%
  (20 new tests).

### Fixed

- All CI Gate warnings silenced: expected retry log lines now captured via
  `assertLogs`, and the perf-test `TaskQueue` capacity raised to 2 000 to
  avoid spurious "queue full" warnings.

### Security

- New `dependabot.yml` ignore rule pinning `@types/vscode` to its
  manually-aligned version, preventing recurring `engines.vscode` /
  `@types/vscode` rebase conflicts.
