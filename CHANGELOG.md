## [Unreleased]

### Chore

- **PyPI Development Status classifier graduated from `4 - Beta` to
  `5 - Production/Stable`** in `pyproject.toml`. v1.5.22 ships 2244 passing
  tests at 90.96% line coverage, zero known CVEs in the production dependency
  chain (post pip-audit wave), and is published on PyPI / Open VSX / VS Code
  Marketplace under v1.5.x; the `Beta` label was an unnecessary speedbump for
  adopters scanning the project page. Pure metadata change — no runtime impact.

## [1.5.22] — 2026-05-04

A maintenance + security release. Runtime CVE exposure cleared from 17
to 0; +32 boundary-tests; full GitHub Community Standards compliance;
PyPI / VSCode marketplace metadata polish; release notes draft and
audit artefacts. Runtime behaviour is functionally unchanged from
v1.5.21 — operators can drop in the new wheel / extension without
config migration.

### Security

- **Dependency vulnerability audit + remediation.** Ran `pip-audit 2.10.0`
  against the v1.5.21 environment, found 17 CVE/GHSA items across 10
  packages, and **upgraded the runtime chain in one coordinated bump**:
  `fastmcp 3.1.1 → 3.2.4` (which cascaded `starlette 0.46 → 1.0`,
  `cryptography 45 → 47`, `cffi 1 → 2`, `python-multipart 0.0.20 → 0.0.27`,
  `werkzeug 3.1.3 → 3.1.8`, `authlib 1.6.9 → 1.7.0`,
  `markdown 3.8 → 3.10.2`, `pygments 2.19 → 2.20`,
  `python-dotenv 1.1 → 1.2.2`). Post-upgrade `pip-audit` reports **1
  remaining finding** (`pytest 8.4.0 / CVE-2025-71176`), which is
  dev-only tooling and intentionally deferred to a separate PR (8 → 9
  is a major version bump). Net production CVE exposure: **17 → 0**.
  Both the pre- (`pip-audit-2026-05-04.json`) and post-upgrade
  (`pip-audit-2026-05-04-post-upgrade.json`) snapshots are committed
  under `docs/security/` for future-baseline diffs.
- **Compat fix in `scripts/test_mcp_client.py`**: fastmcp 3.2 moved the
  private `_convert_to_content` helper from `fastmcp.tools.tool` to
  `fastmcp.tools.base`. The self-check now does a `try/except ImportError`
  fallback so it works on both 3.1 and 3.2+.

### Documentation

- **`docs/mcp_tools.md` / `docs/mcp_tools.zh-CN.md` now document all three
  shapes of `predefined_options`** (simple `list[str]`, object form
  `list[{label, default}]`, and `list[str]` + `predefined_options_defaults`).
  Previously only the simple form was documented; LLM clients had to read
  the source to discover the pre-selection capability shipped in v1.5.20.
  Includes the documented normalisation matrix (truthy alias list, length
  truncate / pad-with-False rule) and side-by-side examples for both new
  shapes.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` clarifies `✅` vs `🧪` test-commit emoji semantics**:
  `🧪` for new / expanded test surface (boundary tests, missing route
  coverage), `✅` for stabilising / fixing / migrating existing tests.

### Chore

- **PyPI metadata gains `Changelog` and `Release notes` Project-URL
  entries** in `pyproject.toml`. PyPI's "Project links" sidebar and
  `pip show` now include direct links to `CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub
  Releases tab.
- **VSCode extension manifest gains `license`, `homepage`, `bugs.url`,
  and `keywords`** in `packages/vscode/package.json`. Marketplace search
  surfaces the extension on common AI workflow keywords (`mcp`, `claude`,
  `cursor`, `windsurf`, …); the License field no longer shows
  `(unknown)`; the Q&A tab links to GitHub Issues.
- **`CITATION.cff` (Citation File Format 1.2.0)** at the repo root, so
  GitHub's "Cite this repository" sidebar button works (renders BibTeX
  / APA / RIS) and Zotero / Zenodo plugins pick up correct metadata.
- **`SUPPORT.md` (bilingual)** — closes the last unchecked item on
  GitHub's Community Standards page. Routes incoming questions by
  topic (defect → bug template, security → private advisory, etc.)
  and lays out maintainer-driven best-effort SLOs (1–3 day ack,
  2-week silent-bump grace) so newcomers know what response time to
  expect.

### Tests

- **Boundary-test hardening for the v1.5.21 line.** Added 32 regression tests
  covering previously-unexercised failure paths and routes that had zero
  coverage. Net effect: full-suite count rose from 2212 to 2244, and overall
  line coverage improved from 89.93% to 90.96%.
  - `tests/test_server_identity.py` — single-icon read failure isolation
    (one corrupt PNG must not nuke the whole `icons` list) +
    `importlib.metadata` exception fallback to `0.0.0+local`.
  - `tests/test_web_ui_routes_system.py` — `/api/system/open-config-file`
    edge cases: empty `_resolve_allowed_paths()`, default target missing on
    disk, explicit editor uninstalled (graceful auto-detect fallback).
  - `tests/test_web_ui_update_language.py` (new file) — `/api/update-language`
    full contract: three valid languages, empty-payload default, unknown /
    empty-string rejection, whitespace stripping, write-failure 500 path.
  - `tests/test_web_ui_routes.py::TestStaticRoutesEdge` — new
    `/manifest.webmanifest` regression point (PWA install banner depends on
    it; v1.5.20 added the route with no test).
  - `tests/test_web_ui_routes.py::TestUpdateFeedbackConfigEndpoint` — error
    branches for `/api/update-feedback-config` (non-int countdown,
    `frontend_countdown=0` "disable timer" semantics, single-field updates,
    no-recognised-fields message, non-dict payload coercion, 500 path with
    i18n message wrapping verification).
  - `tests/test_web_ui_routes.py::TestCreateTask` — full type-coercion matrix
    for `predefined_options_defaults` (TODO #3 field shipped in v1.5.20 with
    zero direct tests): bool / int / float / str-aliases / unknown types,
    plus length truncate / pad-with-False.
  - `tests/test_web_ui_routes.py::TestCloseTask` (new class) —
    `/api/tasks/<id>/close` happy / 404 / 500 (route was untested since
    multi-task feature shipped).
  - `tests/test_web_ui_config.py::TestValidateAllowedNetworks` and
    `TestValidateBlockedIps` — three security-critical branches
    previously skipped: `None` / non-string / empty-string early-reject
    for `allowed_networks`, CIDR normalisation (`10.0.0.1/24` →
    `10.0.0.0/24`) for `blocked_ips`, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 unwrap
    (`::ffff:10.0.0.1` → `10.0.0.1`) so the same physical host can't
    bypass blocklist via dual-stack representation.

## [1.5.21] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **MCP server identity** advertised in the `initialize` response: `name`,
  `version` (auto-resolved from `importlib.metadata`), `instructions` (Chinese
  guide on when to / not to call the tool), `website_url`, and self-contained
  `icons` (4 base64 data URIs covering 32/192/512 PNG + SVG, ~17 KB total, no
  remote CDN dependency).
- **MCP tool annotations** on `interactive_feedback`: `title`,
  `readOnlyHint=False`, `destructiveHint=False`, `idempotentHint=False`,
  `openWorldHint=True`. Clients (ChatGPT Desktop / Claude Desktop / Cursor)
  no longer ask for "destructive operation" confirmation on every call.
- 20 contract tests in `tests/test_tool_annotations.py` and
  `tests/test_server_identity.py` to lock the new metadata and prevent silent
  regressions.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1, bilingual)
  so GitHub's Community Standards page is fully green and new contributors find
  setup / commit-style guidance on the first click.

### Documentation

- New "Server-level metadata" and "Tool-level annotations" sections in
  `docs/mcp_tools.md` and `docs/mcp_tools.zh-CN.md`.
- README and README.zh-CN now highlight the MCP 2025-11-25 spec compliance and
  link to `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Chore

- `.editorconfig` for cross-editor formatting consistency (Python 4-space,
  JS/TS/MD 2-space, Makefile tab), aligned with the existing ruff conventions.
- `.gitattributes` to force LF line endings on text sources (so Windows clones
  do not silently break byte-sensitive tests) and to mark binary assets and
  vendored / generated files for GitHub linguist.

## [1.5.20] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Pydantic-validated fallbacks and alias mapping for `interactive_feedback`,
  so drift parameters (`summary` / `prompt` / `project_directory` /
  `submit_button_text` / `timeout` / `feedback_type` / `priority` /
  `language` / `tags` / `user_id`) no longer break first-call validation.
- Full PWA icon family (`manifest.webmanifest` + 16/32/180/192/512 PNG + SVG)
  with `maskable` purpose for adaptive icons; Web UI now passes Lighthouse
  PWA installability checks.
- Default-selection support for `predefined_options` in three input shapes
  (`str` / `dict` / `list`), with the multi-task UI honouring the default
  while still allowing the user to change it.
- "Open in IDE" button on the settings page, gated by:
  - **Loopback-only** (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) — remote requests are rejected.
  - **Path whitelist** — only the resolved active config file and
    `config.toml.default` are openable; never accepts an arbitrary path.
  - **No shell** — commands are passed as argument lists to `subprocess.Popen`
    with `shell=False`, blocking shell injection.
  - Editor priority: env var `AI_INTERVENTION_AGENT_OPEN_WITH` → request
    `editor` → auto-detect (cursor / code / windsurf / subl / webstorm /
    pycharm) → system default (`open` / `xdg-open` / `start`).
- Bark notification deep-linking via `bark_url_template` with placeholders
  `{task_id}`, `{event_id}`, `{base_url}` so iOS users can jump straight to
  the relevant feedback task.

### Changed

- `PROMPT_MAX_LENGTH` raised from 500 to 10 000 characters to match the
  longer prompts agents now produce.
- `interactive_feedback` docstring overhauled with use cases, parameter
  guidance, and behavior contract — visible to LLM agents at registration.
- VS Code extension `engines.vscode` aligned with `@types/vscode` to keep
  the extension host and the type checker on the same baseline.
- `web_ui_routes/system.py` test coverage raised from 13.02% to 79.53%
  (20 new tests).

### Fixed

- All CI Gate warnings silenced: expected retry log lines now captured via
  `assertLogs`, and the perf-test `TaskQueue` capacity raised to 2 000 to
  avoid spurious "queue full" warnings.

### Security

- New `dependabot.yml` ignore rule pinning `@types/vscode` to its
  manually-aligned version, preventing recurring `engines.vscode` /
  `@types/vscode` rebase conflicts.
